    Gathering pieces of a greasy puzzle since its creation, Red Mess moves itself through a mix of crooked feelings.

    Red Messâ€™s concerts are known to be a <span class="highlight">deep experience with high volumes</span> that somehow express and represent some sort of anger within. This type of experience has always shaped the phonographic approach of the band studio's productions, therefore trying to capture the energy of their live act.
